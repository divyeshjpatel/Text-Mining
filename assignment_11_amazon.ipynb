I am not sure if i made a mistake buying it online. Laptop stopped working on 8th day and i had no option to place a request for replacement. I called customer service of HP they said within 48 hrs technician should visit and it\\'s been more than 48 hrs and i have not even received any call. I spent Rs 42k and as i have to do work from home, my work is hampering also. Cpu turns on but no display. Did all troubleshooting but no improvement for this NEW GEN HP LAPTOP.On 27th HP sent an engineer and they are ready to help howver my case is pending  as of 16th April, as Amazon did not mention the serial num on invoice and p-slip. HP needs invoice with Serial number. I am very much disappointed as i am stuck between two big brands...it is good if machine works fine if you are unlucky then may gonna pissed off after sale. Let\\'s see how long do i have to wait to obtain the correct invoice from HP.Note- accept invoice with sr number mentioned on it then only HP can entertain easily.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hi,I am totally disappointed with this purchase. I have spend the heavy amount but still i couldn\\'t use the product. My request for replacement also not happened due to some irrelevant reason. I bought this laptop for son\\'s study purpose. Due to this bad sales service my son\\'s study also got impacted. Now this defective item is with me last 10 days. If my problem is not resolved in another two days. I will take this issue in next very seriously.Request your immediation action to resolve the issue.Thanks and Regards,Kajamydeen T\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Horrible experience! First there was flinch in the screen ao i had to talk to the customer service for 2 hours before they declared it fit to be replaced. After I got a replaced laptop within 5 days the speakers went off, they started producing the most obnoxious voices. But till i realised i had to return it again it the 8th day and amazon couldn\\'t replace. So I contacted hp they helped me but everyday i had to sit for hours talking to them explaining them their person came home checked it labelled it suitable to be replaced boxed it seqled it saying amazon will pick up. But nothing! Nor from Amazons side nor from hp its been 1 month now my laptop is sealed and kept. I\\'m calling everyday mailing everyday but no response. Its like my 50,000₹ have gone down the drain! Horrible services from both sides!\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I bought HP15s fr 2006tu it was delivered on 27/03/2021.When I was doing simple work but its laptop charger and laptop also getting heating problem so kindly see that and resolve the issue\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Print on the keyboard keys is thin(font size and color) . Keyboard body color is silver. This makes it problematic to read keyboard keys. Especially at night when it shines due to room lights. This is bad design. It should be either in contrast color(black keyboard with white font) or it should come with back-lit keyboard. I even did not like display quality.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           If looking for performance this laptop has best config and price comb. Boot in 5-6 sec. No lag. You get windows and office. Packing was good. All seal were intact.It can easily compete with i 5 9gen.But butbut there are some issuesFirst. The plastic quality is not that good. When you type the whole keypad goes down as the plastic there is thin.Battery backup is only 3-3.5hours with averahe load.The mcafee subscription was over when i got the laptop which is weird. But windows defender overcomes the need of any third party anti virus.Overall for performance its the best bang for your buck. Go for it. Just buy a wireless mouse for better effciencyScreen is also good but could have been brighter\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It seems this laptop has an inbuilt problem...

Missing RJ45 port.I will update my review if I face any issue.\\nI am writing this review after using this laptop for more than a week. I will keep it short and to the point:Good things:1. I just loved its design and it is beautiful. Soothing silver color and very sleek. it just feels nice to touch the smooth surface.2. It is significantly lighter weight.3. Sound is good in this price range, I am satisfied.4. Speed is awesome. Core I3, 11th gen, and the SSD both make it awesome to work.5. Display, it is a bit warm display but very clear. Soothing to eyes. Night mode is also good.6. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. My earlier HP laptop used to drop the connection in between but this works seamlessly.7. it is very thin, I liked it.Things need improvement/ I did not like much:1. It gets heat up in just 30 mins of usage.2. It has only 2 USB ports that too together with charging port. This makes difficult to connect 2 USB and charger at the same time due to size of pen drive or devices port like mouse or external HDD.3. The cooling fan is at the bottom not at the sides which may be causing heat up issues because when you use it on the bed as many times we do, it does not work efficiently.4. Memory of SSD is only 512 GB which gets reduced by almost 100 GB due to OS and all. Of course, this is what is mentioned in the technical specification but this is something which bothers me slightly. They could have given 1 HDD of 1 TB and SSD combination which Dell and other laptops are providing. But this is not that bad. It is fine if you don\\'t store much on the drive and use the cloud.5. Charger pin which we connect with a laptop is not very smooth. It has a lot to improve. I cannot connect smoothly as my earlier Lenovo, Dell, and HP laptops.6. It does not have a CD drive which is something missing. People who have old CDs/DVDs of marriages and functions might miss this, I do :(Conclusion: By and large, this is a perfect laptop for normal usages like studies and work. Not suitable for gaming though. Its lightweight, slim design and soothing silver color appearance backed with 11th gen core i3 processor with SSD makes it perfect and fast to use. I recommend this to users who wanna use it for work and study purposes. I wish the USB port should have been more scattered instead of consolidated near the charging port. Overall, awesome product, I am happy with this.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I made this review after using this laptop for 3 months as a good laptop to buy under 42K.I used it for last two months and I only faced the problem regarding battery life.  Battery consumed very quickly and also there was a issue of  heating. Although heating problem was normal in laptops. Otherwise it was vey fast, response quickly and no lag.  The camera was not so good. It was weighing light and thin and also it has a gloomy metal like finish which makes it\\'s look quite awesome. Overall it was good for normal uses . I got this product without any  fault and as it was depicted in the display.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I am working with i5 & i7 laptops and this is my first laptop i3 haven\\'t notice big difference because of SSD and 11th generation version without hard drive. Setup took very less time , very fast processing. Sound quality good and Picture quality satisfactory. Within this cost I must say it\\'s fabulous, must buy and enjoy working. I will not suggest for gaming purpose. Silver colour body makes executive looks, slim and very handy. Light weight and elegant design. I must give five star but somewhere I don\\'t know I am rating four star.....may be something missing like sound card. Overall it\\'s good laptop. Let\\'s see in coming days how it performs and battery life....good luck.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Product is very poor.

Battery life is good but for having a SSD it took 1 hour for restart after even first update,\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I am using from last few days.

And arising lots of problem\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The build quality is not so great for the price. Even the keys look as if it\\'s painted in bulk. Could have been black and that d make the device look better.About HW, whne the tech improved over years, as I had paid 50k for similar config 10yrs back, with i5 core, 1TB storage, DVD RW, 8gb RAM, Radeon Graphics etc, there is no improvement in price now.Not a config comparable for yhe price expectation over 10yrs.No DVD, no 1TB storage, Not much RAM and still price is same.Considering the Moors law by wich the semicon industry swears by, the actual price of this laptop must be 25k .\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        As I buy this since day when I start using within 2 days 1-fan got faulty2- Hanging issue 3-poor service, I have raised issue with HP but they only checking  hard disc and saying everything is normal , I have already reinstalled the os but issue is not resolved....Dint buy HP and product from Amazon....\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I have been using it from last 2 weeks, and i found this hp 15 fr 2006 laptop the best thin and light laptop in this price segment.. Laptop has good processing speed because of ssd and it generally takes 2-4 secs to switch on and shut down and overall speed while operating i have witnessed its extremely high processing speed better as compare to hdd laptop especially the \"HANG\" problem which is not there in this laptop and gives an extra advantage doing work smoothly. So it works perfectly fine for performing day to day official work. I have followed some of the reviews before buying this laptop and read multiple reviews regarding its heating issue which caught my attention certainly and tried to change my mind, but however i knew that if you buy any machinery it will come with n number of features and advantage and it do have little drawback which every machinery have and its we human who have to deal with it the way we use it in our daily life with self care and effort so i ordered this laptop thinking in positive way and i found that there is minor or simply no heating issue the way other people exaggerated as i have been using it from last 2 weeks and for continously 5 to 6 hours in a laptop with single charge. So overall its a good deal buying this laptop. Just go for it.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I purchased this device with the exchange offer, so it was even cheaper for me..Pros:1. SSD provides great booting time of 4-5 seconds2. Smartly placed vent doesn\\'t make it uncomfortable if it heats up a bit...also, pretty quiet3. i3 11th gen tiger lake cpus are 😎.... Minecraft runs with full graphics settings at 60fps consistently, capable device for coding (not for graphic intensive purposes)4. Sound is pretty good in this speakers, loud, and crisp, but base could have been better, supports spatial audio(headphone output)5. Trackpad is smooth, responsive, supports all gestures6. Active Noise cancelling microphones.7. 5 hours of battery life (at least) for browsing and video streamingCons:1.Camera quality... pretty noisy,2. Lots of bloatware from HP3.an ethernet port and micro SD card slot would be appreciated4. Type c port only upto 4GBPS transfer speed5. Keyboard might feel soft for some (personal preference)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Scratchy sound from speaker even after reinstalling windows. Requesting for replacement.The replaced product worked well for 3 days but now the scratchy sound is back. Requested for Amazon technician to visit.Post technician visit I had to return the Laptop and Amazon has refunded the entire amount.Based on my experience and online research I would like to state that 11th generation Laptop from HP has audio issues. I have now ordered 10th generation Laptop.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Just got it so first observations some might help -There are only 2 USB ports - 1 Type C USB - 1 HDMI Port; 1 card reader ; 1 microphone slotThere is no LAN port - WIFI is there but LAN is faster and added valueSilver color with light grey typed alphabets and no backlit ; I think HP was playing a joke on customer to figure out keys or learn typingBattery life seems ok;  TOUCHED MY LAPTOP AFTER 4Hrs USAGE - CAN COOK AN OMLETTE AT BACKSSD drive is fast so go for it - minimum 512GB makes senseBody quality looks cheap plasticAmazon Prime day sales is a scam - same price and offer available other daysDelivery is super and fastlaptop is lighter than previous versionNo MS OFFICE - ONLY TRIAL VERSION WHICH IS SO IRRITATING.

They say its not covered in warranty. I confronted saying that i should have received a good laptop, iits not matter of warranty and the parrot who called me kept repeating the same lines his boss gave him. and they closed my case, I have no idea what kind of services they intend to provide. This being the fifth laptop in my life this is the first time the i faced issues with keyboard within four months.I received the laptop the keys where stiff, i thought it might get bit loosen with use, it got worst, I just paid my last emi, and the function keys stick in if i press those, would not pop out, the W key is plucked out.

technical details as the basic body design is problematic.The edge is ao sharp that if you are using it for long time the sharp edge puts pressure on your hand around the wrist area depending on size of your hand.For someone wanting to use laptop for long hours its a curse.But the machine has no return policy.Even the keyboard contrast is not really eye friendly.Real disappointment on basic design

Also, there is no MS office pre-installed. I called HP support and they say I have to purchase MS office.  Also the mcafee antivirus trial version say expired 2 months Ago, not sure if this is an used product, it\\'s kind of cheating. Also amazon has rejected my exchange offer at the time of delivery and I had to pay the amount that was offered as exchange because the old laptop\\'s display has few black spots. But at the time of availing the exchange there is no option to mention such issues.Other things I am yet to verify as today only received the product.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Hi, here is my experience after use of 8 months..It\\'s a good laptop which can do everything as per my requirements..

When i try to activate the MS office 2019 product key which is not activated because it is already used and the product warranty shows only 10 month remaining. It is not a good practice the seller delivered a used lap.

Finally I feel better to have this as the Laptop body is stylish and IPS display is awesome.Only minor problem I had was with McAfee which didn\\'t open when I tried to open during first boot of my Windows 10 however after I restarted it opened but funny to see on my first day with the brand new laptop as it said \"Your trial ended 14days ago\". Since product description doesn\\'t say Antivirus subscription I\\'m ok with this.This is my Day-1 experience I will have to see its performance in long run, if any problem I will definitely update my review here.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It\\'s a light weight laptop and quickly boots and shut down.Biggest flaw in this laptop is, it keeps hanging every now and then. You must restart and reconnect to your meeting or classes..Please don\\'t buy this..

In a week itself, it got stuck or restarted on its own several times. Till now it got stuck/restarted more than 50 times. I contacted HPSA and HP Whatsapp support and tried everything to rectify it. 2 days back I did cloud recovery with the help of HP Whatsapp support. After that also, my laptop got stuck/restarted 3 times. I am very unhappy and I regret buying an HP laptop.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I purchased this product. First thing i see is built in quality is very poor. made of poor plastic. Battery is daring like hell...Back up is not more than 4hrs.I wanted to return this laptop on 2nd day of my delivery and buy some other Laptop from Amazon. but As per customer service it is not possible to return this laptop, i can only get replacement with same laptop which i don\\'t want... This puts my concerns to buy any electronic product from Amazon which you have not seen physically. Better to buy this type of products from Local electronic shops though they are bit expensive.I recommend not to buy this laptop online, You will not be able to return or get replacement with other laptop models if you want to.... Worst experience ever....\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Available Warranty is only 9month,also McAfee subscription is already expired either this is a used product or refurbished,set up was simple and  easyPerformance so far is OKBack lit key pad is a must, missing it here\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Got a good exchange deal and a very good and smooth laptopBooting is really quick.Haven\\'t noticed any lags after one month of use.It is light weight and easy to carry.Though sometimes it feels that the screen movement will get loose soon.My only complain is with Amazon, for using huge boxes and lots of dunnage to pack the laptop box.

The laptop is exactly what I expected.  The SSD makes a big difference in the speed of boot and usage.8GB RAM with the laptop is required as even without any applications,  Windows10, antivirus and other startup programs takes up more than 40% RAM.

This was such a pathetic experience....\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I am very impressed with HP laptop because booting is so fast in the system. If I talk about battery backup 4-5 hours is enough. This is not fast charging I can say because it takes more time to charge more than 2 hours 0-100.Sound quality is Awesome. Video quality superior 4K video plays smoothly. No heating or no noise from the system. Overall it deserves 5 star...\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I bought this a couple months ago. It\\'s sleek, elegant, and light. It\\'s working well without any problems. The only problem I have faced is, when my mobile vibrates, the laptop, when beside the mobile, rattles sometimes. I guess it\\'s got to do with the outer casing of the laptop. It\\'s not a major inconvenience though.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The product quality is really bad. Laptop\\'s plastic quality is so bad that while holding the laptop, you will feel the laptop can break any time. Not expected this kind of quality from HP.The keyboard is another big issue here, the characters on the keyboard are very light and are not visible even from 1 meter away. You need to bend down and type the letters.Lastly the amazon service support is also poor, as per the policy they would not replace the product if there are quality issues that I discussed above. They will only replace in case of defect.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Cheap product..

Not able to start it, on starting it says boot device not found. Raised issue with HP customer care, they were not able to solve it and told somebody will contact for part replacement but no body called till now. Did not expect that Amazon will send faulty laptop.

Using for almost 3 months now, a single problem hasn\\'t occurred yet.

Really weird issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It\\'s a awsm laptop with premium looks and great performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 It was good just for 7 days post delivery. I am not sure if i made a mistake buying it online. Laptop stopped working on 8th day and i had no option to place a request for replacement. I called customer service of HP they said within 48 hrs technician should visit and it\\'s been more than 48 hrs and i have not even received any call. I spent Rs 42k and as i have to do work from home, my work is hampering also. Cpu turns on but no display. Did all troubleshooting but no improvement for this NEW GEN HP LAPTOP.On 27th HP sent an engineer and they are ready to help howver my case is pending  as of 16th April, as Amazon did not mention the serial num on invoice and p-slip. HP needs invoice with Serial number. I am very much disappointed as i am stuck between two big brands...it is good if machine works fine if you are unlucky then may gonna pissed off after sale. Let\\'s see how long do i have to wait to obtain the correct invoice from HP.Note- accept invoice with sr number mentioned on it then only HP can entertain easily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hi,I am totally disappointed with this purchase. I have spend the heavy amount but still i couldn\\'t use the product. My request for replacement also not happened due to some irrelevant reason. I bought this laptop for son\\'s study purpose. Due to this bad sales service my son\\'s study also got impacted. Now this defective item is with me last 10 days. If my problem is not resolved in another two days. I will take this issue in next very seriously.Request your immediation action to resolve the issue.Thanks and Regards,Kajamydeen T                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Horrible experience! First there was flinch in the screen ao i had to talk to the customer service for 2 hours before they declared it fit to be replaced. After I got a replaced laptop within 5 days the speakers went off, they started producing the most obnoxious voices. But till i realised i had to return it again it the 8th day and amazon couldn\\'t replace. So I contacted hp they helped me but everyday i had to sit for hours talking to them explaining them their person came home checked it labelled it suitable to be replaced boxed it seqled it saying amazon will pick up. But nothing! Nor from Amazons side nor from hp its been 1 month now my laptop is sealed and kept. I\\'m calling everyday mailing everyday but no response. Its like my 50,000₹ have gone down the drain! Horrible services from both sides!

Keyboard body color is silver. This makes it problematic to read keyboard keys. Especially at night when it shines due to room lights. This is bad design. It should be either in contrast color(black keyboard with white font) or it should come with back-lit keyboard. I even did not like display quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           If looking for performance this laptop has best config and price comb. Boot in 5-6 sec. No lag. You get windows and office. Packing was good. All seal were intact.It can easily compete with i 5 9gen.But butbut there are some issuesFirst. The plastic quality is not that good. When you type the whole keypad goes down as the plastic there is thin.Battery backup is only 3-3.5hours with averahe load.The mcafee subscription was over when i got the laptop which is weird. But windows defender overcomes the need of any third party anti virus.Overall for performance its the best bang for your buck. Go for it. Just buy a wireless mouse for better effciencyScreen is also good but could have been brighter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It seems this laptop has an inbuilt problem... As somebody mentioned in the review, the laptop frequently hangs (lots of pixels appear on screen) and restarts after that... I don\\'t recommend this laptop to anybody...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Bought it for 41999, so far haven\\'t faced any issue.Not so good things to consider before you purchase it:1. build quality: very fragile, won\\'t survive a drop.2. speaker: average.3. camera: below average.4. Missing RJ45 port.I will update my review if I face any issue.I am writing this review after using this laptop for more than a week. I will keep it short and to the point:Good things:1. I just loved its design and it is beautiful. Soothing silver color and very sleek. it just feels nice to touch the smooth surface.2. It is significantly lighter weight.3. Sound is good in this price range, I am satisfied.4. Speed is awesome. Core I3, 11th gen, and the SSD both make it awesome to work.5. Display, it is a bit warm display but very clear. Soothing to eyes. Night mode is also good.6. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. My earlier HP laptop used to drop the connection in between but this works seamlessly.7. it is very thin, I liked it.Things need improvement/ I did not like much:1. It gets heat up in just 30 mins of usage.2. It has only 2 USB ports that too together with charging port. This makes difficult to connect 2 USB and charger at the same time due to size of pen drive or devices port like mouse or external HDD.3. The cooling fan is at the bottom not at the sides which may be causing heat up issues because when you use it on the bed as many times we do, it does not work efficiently.4. Memory of SSD is only 512 GB which gets reduced by almost 100 GB due to OS and all. Of course, this is what is mentioned in the technical specification but this is something which bothers me slightly. They could have given 1 HDD of 1 TB and SSD combination which Dell and other laptops are providing. But this is not that bad. It is fine if you don\\'t store much on the drive and use the cloud.5. Charger pin which we connect with a laptop is not very smooth. It has a lot to improve. I cannot connect smoothly as my earlier Lenovo, Dell, and HP laptops.6. It does not have a CD drive which is something missing. People who have old CDs/DVDs of marriages and functions might miss this, I do :(Conclusion: By and large, this is a perfect laptop for normal usages like studies and work. Not suitable for gaming though. Its lightweight, slim design and soothing silver color appearance backed with 11th gen core i3 processor with SSD makes it perfect and fast to use. I recommend this to users who wanna use it for work and study purposes. I wish the USB port should have been more scattered instead of consolidated near the charging port. Overall, awesome product, I am happy with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I made this review after using this laptop for 3 months as a good laptop to buy under 42K.I used it for last two months and I only faced the problem regarding battery life.  Battery consumed very quickly and also there was a issue of  heating. Although heating problem was normal in laptops. Otherwise it was vey fast, response quickly and no lag.  The camera was not so good. It was weighing light and thin and also it has a gloomy metal like finish which makes it\\'s look quite awesome. Overall it was good for normal uses . I got this product without any  fault and as it was depicted in the display.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I am working with i5 & i7 laptops and this is my first laptop i3 haven\\'t notice big difference because of SSD and 11th generation version without hard drive. Setup took very less time , very fast processing. Sound quality good and Picture quality satisfactory. Within this cost I must say it\\'s fabulous, must buy and enjoy working. I will not suggest for gaming purpose. Silver colour body makes executive looks, slim and very handy. Light weight and elegant design. I must give five star but somewhere I don\\'t know I am rating four star.....may be something missing like sound card. Overall it\\'s good laptop. Let\\'s see in coming days how it performs and battery life....good luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Product is very poor. Product finishing is very bad. I have a doubt that whether it is original or not.

Battery life is good but for having a SSD it took 1 hour for restart after even first update,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I am using from last few days. Every thing is doing well, amazing speed, no lags, speakers, mic is well. Installation is fast and easy. Even heavy softwares run smoothly. Till now I am fully satisfied. If I found something wrong in coming days I will inform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This laptop closed many times. Screen always gets crashed if we are watching any video Or doing any work . And exchange date has also crossed. I m not satisfied with the laptop. Only 10 Or 12 days has crossed.. And arising lots of problem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The build quality is not so great for the price. Even the keys look as if it\\'s painted in bulk. Could have been black and that d make the device look better.About HW, whne the tech improved over years, as I had paid 50k for similar config 10yrs back, with i5 core, 1TB storage, DVD RW, 8gb RAM, Radeon Graphics etc, there is no improvement in price now.Not a config comparable for yhe price expectation over 10yrs.No DVD, no 1TB storage, Not much RAM and still price is same.Considering the Moors law by wich the semicon industry swears by, the actual price of this laptop must be 25k .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        As I buy this since day when I start using within 2 days 1-fan got faulty2- Hanging issue 3-poor service, I have raised issue with HP but they only checking  hard disc and saying everything is normal , I have already reinstalled the os but issue is not resolved....Dint buy HP and product from Amazon....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I have been using it from last 2 weeks, and i found this hp 15 fr 2006 laptop the best thin and light laptop in this price segment.. Laptop has good processing speed because of ssd and it generally takes 2-4 secs to switch on and shut down and overall speed while operating i have witnessed its extremely high processing speed better as compare to hdd laptop especially the \"HANG\" problem which is not there in this laptop and gives an extra advantage doing work smoothly. So it works perfectly fine for performing day to day official work. I have followed some of the reviews before buying this laptop and read multiple reviews regarding its heating issue which caught my attention certainly and tried to change my mind, but however i knew that if you buy any machinery it will come with n number of features and advantage and it do have little drawback which every machinery have and its we human who have to deal with it the way we use it in our daily life with self care and effort so i ordered this laptop thinking in positive way and i found that there is minor or simply no heating issue the way other people exaggerated as i have been using it from last 2 weeks and for continously 5 to 6 hours in a laptop with single charge. So overall its a good deal buying this laptop. Just go for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I purchased this device with the exchange offer, so it was even cheaper for me..Pros:1. SSD provides great booting time of 4-5 seconds2. Smartly placed vent doesn\\'t make it uncomfortable if it heats up a bit...also, pretty quiet3. i3 11th gen tiger lake cpus are 😎.... Minecraft runs with full graphics settings at 60fps consistently, capable device for coding (not for graphic intensive purposes)4. Sound is pretty good in this speakers, loud, and crisp, but base could have been better, supports spatial audio(headphone output)5. Trackpad is smooth, responsive, supports all gestures6. Active Noise cancelling microphones.7. 5 hours of battery life (at least) for browsing and video streamingCons:1.Camera quality... pretty noisy,2. Lots of bloatware from HP3.an ethernet port and micro SD card slot would be appreciated4. Type c port only upto 4GBPS transfer speed5. Keyboard might feel soft for some (personal preference)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Scratchy sound from speaker even after reinstalling windows. Requesting for replacement.The replaced product worked well for 3 days but now the scratchy sound is back. Requested for Amazon technician to visit.Post technician visit I had to return the Laptop and Amazon has refunded the entire amount.Based on my experience and online research I would like to state that 11th generation Laptop from HP has audio issues. I have now ordered 10th generation Laptop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Just got it so first observations some might help -There are only 2 USB ports - 1 Type C USB - 1 HDMI Port; 1 card reader ; 1 microphone slotThere is no LAN port - WIFI is there but LAN is faster and added valueSilver color with light grey typed alphabets and no backlit ; I think HP was playing a joke on customer to figure out keys or learn typingBattery life seems ok;  TOUCHED MY LAPTOP AFTER 4Hrs USAGE - CAN COOK AN OMLETTE AT BACKSSD drive is fast so go for it - minimum 512GB makes senseBody quality looks cheap plasticAmazon Prime day sales is a scam - same price and offer available other daysDelivery is super and fastlaptop is lighter than previous versionNo MS OFFICE - ONLY TRIAL VERSION WHICH IS SO IRRITATING.

On 2nd day of use after unpacking the box, all of a sudden the CPU fan started making cranking sound and screen got frozen. This happened again on the 4th day. I am returning it now. Very disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          received a faulty laptop (keyboard issue), and when i reached out to HP CC, experienced the worst ever. They say its not covered in warranty. I confronted saying that i should have received a good laptop, iits not matter of warranty and the parrot who called me kept repeating the same lines his boss gave him. and they closed my case, I have no idea what kind of services they intend to provide. This being the fifth laptop in my life this is the first time the i faced issues with keyboard within four months.I received the laptop the keys where stiff, i thought it might get bit loosen with use, it got worst, I just paid my last emi, and the function keys stick in if i press those, would not pop out, the W key is plucked out. Customer care people are arrogant as always, pretending like they doing us favour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        No point of getting into technical details as the basic body design is problematic.The edge is ao sharp that if you are using it for long time the sharp edge puts pressure on your hand around the wrist area depending on size of your hand.For someone wanting to use laptop for long hours its a curse.But the machine has no return policy.Even the keyboard contrast is not really eye friendly.Real disappointment on basic design front.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Product delivery took time, but was delivered without any issues.Laptop looks good with silver color.Speaker quality is good.Screen quality is good.Boot time is quick.Leight weight and build quality is good (plastic) for this price range.Performance seems good, need to wait and watch.Battery life need to check.Webcam average, still managable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The processor is 3Ghz not 4 as mentioned in description. Also, there is no MS office pre-installed. I called HP support and they say I have to purchase MS office.  Also the mcafee antivirus trial version say expired 2 months Ago, not sure if this is an used product, it\\'s kind of cheating. Also amazon has rejected my exchange offer at the time of delivery and I had to pay the amount that was offered as exchange because the old laptop\\'s display has few black spots. But at the time of availing the exchange there is no option to mention such issues.Other things I am yet to verify as today only received the product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Hi, here is my experience after use of 8 months..It\\'s a good laptop which can do everything as per my requirements.. I m not a gamer or coder.

The free antivirus that comes with the product was already expired. Also the warranty for 1 year was reduced . Laptop stopped working within a week of purchase. Seems that a used piece was delivered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The seller Appario private limited delivered me pre used one. When i try to activate the MS office 2019 product key which is not activated because it is already used and the product warranty shows only 10 month remaining. It is not a good practice the seller delivered a used lap. Returned the lap and amazon issued refund without delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Before purchase I compared similar configuration of Dell Vostro which was 5K less than this HP and Dell Inspiron which was 2.5K more than this HP. Finally I feel better to have this as the Laptop body is stylish and IPS display is awesome.Only minor problem I had was with McAfee which didn\\'t open when I tried to open during first boot of my Windows 10 however after I restarted it opened but funny to see on my first day with the brand new laptop as it said \"Your trial ended 14days ago\". Since product description doesn\\'t say Antivirus subscription I\\'m ok with this.This is my Day-1 experience I will have to see its performance in long run, if any problem I will definitely update my review here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It\\'s a light weight laptop and quickly boots and shut down.Biggest flaw in this laptop is, it keeps hanging every now and then. You must restart and reconnect to your meeting or classes..Please don\\'t buy this..

I bought an HP laptop on 23rd March, through Amazon. In a week itself, it got stuck or restarted on its own several times. Till now it got stuck/restarted more than 50 times. I contacted HPSA and HP Whatsapp support and tried everything to rectify it. 2 days back I did cloud recovery with the help of HP Whatsapp support. After that also, my laptop got stuck/restarted 3 times. I am very unhappy and I regret buying an HP laptop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I purchased this product. First thing i see is built in quality is very poor. made of poor plastic. Battery is daring like hell...Back up is not more than 4hrs.I wanted to return this laptop on 2nd day of my delivery and buy some other Laptop from Amazon. but As per customer service it is not possible to return this laptop, i can only get replacement with same laptop which i don\\'t want... This puts my concerns to buy any electronic product from Amazon which you have not seen physically. Better to buy this type of products from Local electronic shops though they are bit expensive.I recommend not to buy this laptop online, You will not be able to return or get replacement with other laptop models if you want to.... Worst experience ever....

It is unnecessary wastage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Please don\\'t buy this laptop.i purchased this laptop , within 10 days I found many issues with this laptop.some times system gets hanged.im facing lot off problem with keyboard,caps lock automatically on Nd it will not respond even if we try to off.Finally my opinion is not to buy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Delivered a day earlier.  The laptop is exactly what I expected.  The SSD makes a big difference in the speed of boot and usage.8GB RAM with the laptop is required as even without any applications,  Windows10, antivirus and other startup programs takes up more than 40% RAM. Alexa is a good add on. All in all a good buy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Received a faulty laptop, amazon sent an executive next day and confrmed the same. Thanks to Amazon for approving the refund, however pick up guy delayed the process of refund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Recently for my earlier pc (from hp itself) I came to know that the extended warranty, I had taken was of no use, when it came to changing the expensive battery(this is the part which most often goes bad) so when it comes to getting the battery replaced, extended warranty of no use.... This was such a pathetic experience....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I am very impressed with HP laptop because booting is so fast in the system. If I talk about battery backup 4-5 hours is enough. This is not fast charging I can say because it takes more time to charge more than 2 hours 0-100.Sound quality is Awesome. Video quality superior 4K video plays smoothly. No heating or no noise from the system. Overall it deserves 5 star...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I bought this a couple months ago. It\\'s sleek, elegant, and light. It\\'s working well without any problems. The only problem I have faced is, when my mobile vibrates, the laptop, when beside the mobile, rattles sometimes. I guess it\\'s got to do with the outer casing of the laptop. It\\'s not a major inconvenience though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The product quality is really bad. Laptop\\'s plastic quality is so bad that while holding the laptop, you will feel the laptop can break any time. Not expected this kind of quality from HP.The keyboard is another big issue here, the characters on the keyboard are very light and are not visible even from 1 meter away. You need to bend down and type the letters.Lastly the amazon service support is also poor, as per the policy they would not replace the product if there are quality issues that I discussed above.

Not able to start it, on starting it says boot device not found. Raised issue with HP customer care, they were not able to solve it and told somebody will contact for part replacement but no body called till now. Did not expect that Amazon will send faulty laptop. Pathetic service from Amazon and HP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The warranty is found to have started around 4 months before I purchased the laptop, I couldn’t understand the issue. Is it a used one?

I think it\\'s high time for HP to deal with this.

Also I have returned it twice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Actually, this product does not have a fingerprint sensor.

I am using lap table there is enough space for air circulation and it\\'s start heating up with in 5 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       This laptop has serious heating issues.

       "\"In specification , mentioned 4 1 Ghz processes but I received 3.0 GHz processor . It is a cheating . Seller take money for high configuration and provide low configuration 😥 While setting up the laptop , screen went wonky ... total colour distortion and hung up . Have asked replacement .... do n't know if it 's worth buying Speaker is buzzing , new laptop , out of the boxEdit : The replacement laptop speaker is the same . You wo n't hear the buzzing while listening to a song or video however while increasing or decreasing system volume , the chimes crack , also for Windows pop ups , the chime sound cracks at more than 50 % volume . Really weird issue . It 's a awsm laptop with premium looks and great performance . It was good just for 7 days post delivery . I am not sure if i made a mistake buying it online . Laptop stopped working on 8th day and i had no option to place a request for replacement . I called customer service of HP they said within 48 hrs technician should visit and it 's been more than 48 hrs and i have not even received any call . I spent Rs 42k and as i have to do work from home , my work is hampering also . Cpu turns on but no display . Did all troubleshooting but no improvement for this NEW GEN HP LAPTOP.On 27th HP sent an engineer and they are ready to help howver my case is pending as of 16th April , as Amazon did not mention the serial num on invoice and p-slip . HP needs invoice with Serial number . I am very much disappointed as i am stuck between two big brands ... it is good if machine works fine if you are unlucky then may gon na pissed off after sale . Let 's see how long do i have to wait to obtain the correct invoice from HP.Note- accept invoice with sr number mentioned on it then only HP can entertain easily . Hi , I am totally disappointed with this purchase . I have spend the heavy amount but still i could n't use the product . My request for replacement also not happened due to some irrelevant reason . I bought this laptop for son 's study purpose . Due to this bad sales service my son 's study also got impacted . Now this defective item is with me last 10 days . If my problem is not resolved in another two days . I will take this issue in next very seriously.Request your immediation action to resolve the issue.Thanks and Regards , Kajamydeen T Horrible experience ! First there was flinch in the screen ao i had to talk to the customer service for 2 hours before they declared it fit to be replaced . After I got a replaced laptop within 5 days the speakers went off , they started producing the most obnoxious voices . But till i realised i had to return it again it the 8th day and amazon could n't replace . So I contacted hp they helped me but everyday i had to sit for hours talking to them explaining them their person came home checked it labelled it suitable to be replaced boxed it seqled it saying amazon will pick up . But nothing ! Nor from Amazons side nor from hp its been 1 month now my laptop is sealed and kept . I 'm calling everyday mailing everyday but no response . Its like my 50,000₹ have gone down the drain ! Horrible services from both sides ! I bought HP15s fr 2006tu it was delivered on 27/03/2021.When I was doing simple work but its laptop charger and laptop also getting heating problem so kindly see that and resolve the issue Print on the keyboard keys is thin ( font size and color ) . Keyboard body color is silver . This makes it problematic to read keyboard keys . Especially at night when it shines due to room lights . This is bad design . It should be either in contrast color ( black keyboard with white font ) or it should come with back-lit keyboard . I even did not like display quality . If looking for performance this laptop has best config and price comb . Boot in 5-6 sec . No lag . You get windows and office . Packing was good . All seal were intact.It can easily compete with i 5 9gen.But butbut there are some issuesFirst . The plastic quality is not that good . When you type the whole keypad goes down as the plastic there is thin.Battery backup is only 3-3.5hours with averahe load.The mcafee subscription was over when i got the laptop which is weird . But windows defender overcomes the need of any third party anti virus.Overall for performance its the best bang for your buck . Go for it . Just buy a wireless mouse for better effciencyScreen is also good but could have been brighter It seems this laptop has an inbuilt problem ... As somebody mentioned in the review , the laptop frequently hangs ( lots of pixels appear on screen ) and restarts after that ... I do n't recommend this laptop to anybody ... Bought it for 41999 , so far have n't faced any issue.Not so good things to consider before you purchase it:1. build quality : very fragile , wo n't survive a drop.2 . speaker : average.3 . camera : below average.4 . Missing RJ45 port.I will update my review if I face any issue.I am writing this review after using this laptop for more than a week . I will keep it short and to the point : Good things:1 . I just loved its design and it is beautiful . Soothing silver color and very sleek . it just feels nice to touch the smooth surface.2 . It is significantly lighter weight.3 . Sound is good in this price range , I am satisfied.4 . Speed is awesome . Core I3 , 11th gen , and the SSD both make it awesome to work.5 . Display , it is a bit warm display but very clear . Soothing to eyes . Night mode is also good.6 . Bluetooth connectivity is also great . My earlier HP laptop used to drop the connection in between but this works seamlessly.7 . it is very thin , I liked it.Things need improvement/ I did not like much:1 . It gets heat up in just 30 mins of usage.2 . It has only 2 USB ports that too together with charging port . This makes difficult to connect 2 USB and charger at the same time due to size of pen drive or devices port like mouse or external HDD.3 . The cooling fan is at the bottom not at the sides which may be causing heat up issues because when you use it on the bed as many times we do , it does not work efficiently.4 . Memory of SSD is only 512 GB which gets reduced by almost 100 GB due to OS and all . Of course , this is what is mentioned in the technical specification but this is something which bothers me slightly . They could have given 1 HDD of 1 TB and SSD combination which Dell and other laptops are providing . But this is not that bad . It is fine if you do n't store much on the drive and use the cloud.5 . Charger pin which we connect with a laptop is not very smooth . It has a lot to improve . I can not connect smoothly as my earlier Lenovo , Dell , and HP laptops.6 . It does not have a CD drive which is something missing . People who have old CDs/DVDs of marriages and functions might miss this , I do : ( Conclusion : By and large , this is a perfect laptop for normal usages like studies and work . Not suitable for gaming though . Its lightweight , slim design and soothing silver color appearance backed with 11th gen core i3 processor with SSD makes it perfect and fast to use . I recommend this to users who wan na use it for work and study purposes . I wish the USB port should have been more scattered instead of consolidated near the charging port . Overall , awesome product , I am happy with this . I made this review after using this laptop for 3 months as a good laptop to buy under 42K.I used it for last two months and I only faced the problem regarding battery life . Battery consumed very quickly and also there was a issue of heating . Although heating problem was normal in laptops . Otherwise it was vey fast , response quickly and no lag . The camera was not so good . It was weighing light and thin and also it has a gloomy metal like finish which makes it 's look quite awesome . Overall it was good for normal uses . I got this product without any fault and as it was depicted in the display . I am working with i5 & i7 laptops and this is my first laptop i3 have n't notice big difference because of SSD and 11th generation version without hard drive . Setup took very less time , very fast processing . Sound quality good and Picture quality satisfactory . Within this cost I must say it 's fabulous , must buy and enjoy working . I will not suggest for gaming purpose . Silver colour body makes executive looks , slim and very handy . Light weight and elegant design . I must give five star but somewhere I do n't know I am rating four star ..... may be something missing like sound card . Overall it 's good laptop . Let 's see in coming days how it performs and battery life .... good luck . Product is very poor . Product finishing is very bad . I have a doubt that whether it is original or not . This computer hanged on first day ... I had to force restart it . Battery life is good but for having a SSD it took 1 hour for restart after even first update , I am using from last few days . Every thing is doing well , amazing speed , no lags , speakers , mic is well . Installation is fast and easy . Even heavy softwares run smoothly . Till now I am fully satisfied . If I found something wrong in coming days I will inform . This laptop closed many times . Screen always gets crashed if we are watching any video Or doing any work . And exchange date has also crossed . I m not satisfied with the laptop . Only 10 Or 12 days has crossed .. And arising lots of problem The build quality is not so great for the price . Even the keys look as if it 's painted in bulk . Could have been black and that d make the device look better.About HW , whne the tech improved over years , as I had paid 50k for similar config 10yrs back , with i5 core , 1TB storage , DVD RW , 8gb RAM , Radeon Graphics etc , there is no improvement in price now.Not a config comparable for yhe price expectation over 10yrs.No DVD , no 1TB storage , Not much RAM and still price is same.Considering the Moors law by wich the semicon industry swears by , the actual price of this laptop must be 25k . As I buy this since day when I start using within 2 days 1-fan got faulty2- Hanging issue 3-poor service , I have raised issue with HP but they only checking hard disc and saying everything is normal , I have already reinstalled the os but issue is not resolved .... Dint buy HP and product from Amazon .... I have been using it from last 2 weeks , and i found this hp 15 fr 2006 laptop the best thin and light laptop in this price segment .. Laptop has good processing speed because of ssd and it generally takes 2-4 secs to switch on and shut down and overall speed while operating i have witnessed its extremely high processing speed better as compare to hdd laptop especially the `` HANG '' problem which is not there in this laptop and gives an extra advantage doing work smoothly . So it works perfectly fine for performing day to day official work . I have followed some of the reviews before buying this laptop and read multiple reviews regarding its heating issue which caught my attention certainly and tried to change my mind , but however i knew that if you buy any machinery it will come with n number of features and advantage and it do have little drawback which every machinery have and its we human who have to deal with it the way we use it in our daily life with self care and effort so i ordered this laptop thinking in positive way and i found that there is minor or simply no heating issue the way other people exaggerated as i have been using it from last 2 weeks and for continously 5 to 6 hours in a laptop with single charge . So overall its a good deal buying this laptop . Just go for it . I purchased this device with the exchange offer , so it was even cheaper for me .. Pros:1 . SSD provides great booting time of 4-5 seconds2 . Smartly placed vent does n't make it uncomfortable if it heats up a bit ... also , pretty quiet3 . i3 11th gen tiger lake cpus are 😎 .... Minecraft runs with full graphics settings at 60fps consistently , capable device for coding ( not for graphic intensive purposes ) 4 . Sound is pretty good in this speakers , loud , and crisp , but base could have been better , supports spatial audio ( headphone output ) 5 . Trackpad is smooth , responsive , supports all gestures6 . Active Noise cancelling microphones.7 . 5 hours of battery life ( at least ) for browsing and video streamingCons:1.Camera quality ... pretty noisy,2 . Lots of bloatware from HP3.an ethernet port and micro SD card slot would be appreciated4 . Type c port only upto 4GBPS transfer speed5 . Keyboard might feel soft for some ( personal preference ) Scratchy sound from speaker even after reinstalling windows . Requesting for replacement.The replaced product worked well for 3 days but now the scratchy sound is back . Requested for Amazon technician to visit.Post technician visit I had to return the Laptop and Amazon has refunded the entire amount.Based on my experience and online research I would like to state that 11th generation Laptop from HP has audio issues . I have now ordered 10th generation Laptop . Just got it so first observations some might help -There are only 2 USB ports - 1 Type C USB - 1 HDMI Port ; 1 card reader ; 1 microphone slotThere is no LAN port - WIFI is there but LAN is faster and added valueSilver color with light grey typed alphabets and no backlit ; I think HP was playing a joke on customer to figure out keys or learn typingBattery life seems ok ; TOUCHED MY LAPTOP AFTER 4Hrs USAGE - CAN COOK AN OMLETTE AT BACKSSD drive is fast so go for it - minimum 512GB makes senseBody quality looks cheap plasticAmazon Prime day sales is a scam - same price and offer available other daysDelivery is super and fastlaptop is lighter than previous versionNo MS OFFICE - ONLY TRIAL VERSION WHICH IS SO IRRITATING . YOU CHARGE SO MUCH AND CANT OFFER OFFICEOverall at this price is a good dealHope it works as good over a longer period of time First my husband ordered a HP laptop from his account which we had to return as a used piece was sent to us which had many technical issues , after a long struggle and completing various protocol we returned the laptop and for the money back . NOW SECOND TIME I ORDERED WINDOWS 10 FROM MY ACCOUNT BUT I RECEIVED WINDOWS 8 WHEREAS I PAID FOR WINDOWS 10 . STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO EXCHANGE IT . BAD DECISION TO INVEST IN HP GUYS . This laptop I had purchased on 13 August and got on 18 . I am writing this review after 10 days of usage . Till now , it is working best.PROS : -Best speed of laptop.Budget LaptopBest displayLightWeightBoot time is 8 secondsIncredible speed.CONS : -No Cons.GO FOR IT.I will edit the review if there is some problem . On 2nd day of use after unpacking the box , all of a sudden the CPU fan started making cranking sound and screen got frozen . This happened again on the 4th day . I am returning it now . Very disappointed . received a faulty laptop ( keyboard issue ) , and when i reached out to HP CC , experienced the worst ever . They say its not covered in warranty . I confronted saying that i should have received a good laptop , iits not matter of warranty and the parrot who called me kept repeating the same lines his boss gave him . and they closed my case , I have no idea what kind of services they intend to provide . This being the fifth laptop in my life this is the first time the i faced issues with keyboard within four months.I received the laptop the keys where stiff , i thought it might get bit loosen with use , it got worst , I just paid my last emi , and the function keys stick in if i press those , would not pop out , the W key is plucked out . Customer care people are arrogant as always , pretending like they doing us favour . No point of getting into technical details as the basic body design is problematic.The edge is ao sharp that if you are using it for long time the sharp edge puts pressure on your hand around the wrist area depending on size of your hand.For someone wanting to use laptop for long hours its a curse.But the machine has no return policy.Even the keyboard contrast is not really eye friendly.Real disappointment on basic design front . Product delivery took time , but was delivered without any issues.Laptop looks good with silver color.Speaker quality is good.Screen quality is good.Boot time is quick.Leight weight and build quality is good ( plastic ) for this price range.Performance seems good , need to wait and watch.Battery life need to check.Webcam average , still managable . The processor is 3Ghz not 4 as mentioned in description . Also , there is no MS office pre-installed . I called HP support and they say I have to purchase MS office . Also the mcafee antivirus trial version say expired 2 months Ago , not sure if this is an used product , it 's kind of cheating . Also amazon has rejected my exchange offer at the time of delivery and I had to pay the amount that was offered as exchange because the old laptop 's display has few black spots . But at the time of availing the exchange there is no option to mention such issues.Other things I am yet to verify as today only received the product . Hi , here is my experience after use of 8 months .. It 's a good laptop which can do everything as per my requirements .. I m not a gamer or coder . Surfing , dowloading , online classes , meetings etc can be done without any hassle.Battery is 4 hours only . You can watch 2 movies back to back.Connectivity is good.Almost all apps are working.It 's very fast due to ssd . On and Off in just 4 seconds.Sound output is good.Microphone is also good.Win 11 free updateIt 's heavy.It 's heating much during video call and online classes . The free antivirus that comes with the product was already expired . Also the warranty for 1 year was reduced . Laptop stopped working within a week of purchase . Seems that a used piece was delivered The seller Appario private limited delivered me pre used one . When i try to activate the MS office 2019 product key which is not activated because it is already used and the product warranty shows only 10 month remaining . It is not a good practice the seller delivered a used lap . Returned the lap and amazon issued refund without delay . Before purchase I compared similar configuration of Dell Vostro which was 5K less than this HP and Dell Inspiron which was 2.5K more than this HP . Finally I feel better to have this as the Laptop body is stylish and IPS display is awesome.Only minor problem I had was with McAfee which did n't open when I tried to open during first boot of my Windows 10 however after I restarted it opened but funny to see on my first day with the brand new laptop as it said `` Your trial ended 14days ago '' . Since product description does n't say Antivirus subscription I 'm ok with this.This is my Day-1 experience I will have to see its performance in long run , if any problem I will definitely update my review here . It 's a light weight laptop and quickly boots and shut down.Biggest flaw in this laptop is , it keeps hanging every now and then . You must restart and reconnect to your meeting or classes .. Please do n't buy this .. I had very good laptops from HP earlier but this is not worth it.Avoid buying Battery last for whole day work from home . Very light weight as compared to my previous Dell Laptop . There is no fingerprint reader or CD/DVD writer . Image from all dimension has been uploaded by me for information of any future buyer . It have great speed as it 's 11th Gen i3 processor & 8 GB RAM with SSD for quick start . Window operating system clash with one week , hp service center denied to attend , as per discussion with them there is no any issue at hardware side so they do nothing.gave customer care number of software site of hp for on line support , When I bought this laptop it was mentioned windows 10 over there ... but during setup it automatically updated to windows 11 .that windows 11 laptop was little bit of lower price in online .. but its ok .... i liked the quality and performance ... below this i have written advantages and disadvantagesAdvantages -It is the one of the best laptops . battery backup is good and light weight also . and main thing its performance is outstanding ... because of SSD .very smooth running laptop . Microsoft office 2019 version for lifetime which i liked the most .. you can buy it also . it is good for student and you can also use autoCAD software . overall built quality is good and looking also good .Disadvantages -it is not for high gamming performance laptop and price is little bit of high .. It 's been only two days my laptop is not charging .wow my brother have same laptop but luckily not purchase from Amazon because Amazon always have habit to delivered defective or replaced one . I will suggest not to purchase laptop from Amazon better purchase offline when I asked for return there a huge long process how I mean and here we are suffering like hell . I bought an HP laptop on 23rd March , through Amazon . In a week itself , it got stuck or restarted on its own several times . Till now it got stuck/restarted more than 50 times . I contacted HPSA and HP Whatsapp support and tried everything to rectify it . 2 days back I did cloud recovery with the help of HP Whatsapp support . After that also , my laptop got stuck/restarted 3 times . I am very unhappy and I regret buying an HP laptop . I purchased this product . First thing i see is built in quality is very poor . made of poor plastic . Battery is daring like hell ... Back up is not more than 4hrs.I wanted to return this laptop on 2nd day of my delivery and buy some other Laptop from Amazon . but As per customer service it is not possible to return this laptop , i can only get replacement with same laptop which i do n't want ... This puts my concerns to buy any electronic product from Amazon which you have not seen physically . Better to buy this type of products from Local electronic shops though they are bit expensive.I recommend not to buy this laptop online , You will not be able to return or get replacement with other laptop models if you want to .... Worst experience ever .... Available Warranty is only 9month , also McAfee subscription is already expired either this is a used product or refurbished , set up was simple and easyPerformance so far is OKBack lit key pad is a must , missing it here Got a good exchange deal and a very good and smooth laptopBooting is really quick.Have n't noticed any lags after one month of use.It is light weight and easy to carry.Though sometimes it feels that the screen movement will get loose soon.My only complain is with Amazon , for using huge boxes and lots of dunnage to pack the laptop box . It is unnecessary wastage . Please do n't buy this laptop.i purchased this laptop , within 10 days I found many issues with this laptop.some times system gets hanged.im facing lot off problem with keyboard , caps lock automatically on Nd it will not respond even if we try to off.Finally my opinion is not to buy . Delivered a day earlier . The laptop is exactly what I expected . The SSD makes a big difference in the speed of boot and usage.8GB RAM with the laptop is required as even without any applications , Windows10 , antivirus and other startup programs takes up more than 40 % RAM . Alexa is a good add on . All in all a good buy . Received a faulty laptop , amazon sent an executive next day and confrmed the same . Thanks to Amazon for approving the refund , however pick up guy delayed the process of refund . Recently for my earlier pc ( from hp itself ) I came to know that the extended warranty , I had taken was of no use , when it came to changing the expensive battery ( this is the part which most often goes bad ) so when it comes to getting the battery replaced , extended warranty of no use .... This was such a pathetic experience .... I am very impressed with HP laptop because booting is so fast in the system . If I talk about battery backup 4-5 hours is enough . This is not fast charging I can say because it takes more time to charge more than 2 hours 0-100.Sound quality is Awesome . Video quality superior 4K video plays smoothly . No heating or no noise from the system . Overall it deserves 5 star ... I bought this a couple months ago . It 's sleek , elegant , and light . It 's working well without any problems . The only problem I have faced is , when my mobile vibrates , the laptop , when beside the mobile , rattles sometimes . I guess it 's got to do with the outer casing of the laptop . It 's not a major inconvenience though . The product quality is really bad . Laptop 's plastic quality is so bad that while holding the laptop , you will feel the laptop can break any time . Not expected this kind of quality from HP.The keyboard is another big issue here , the characters on the keyboard are very light and are not visible even from 1 meter away . You need to bend down and type the letters.Lastly the amazon service support is also poor , as per the policy they would not replace the product if there are quality issues that I discussed above . They will only replace in case of defect . Cheap product .. Already has someone else 's log in and felt like refurbished product very disappointed in amazon and seller instead of providing replacement giving refund Worst product ..... after operating the laptop for 5 minutes the screen got invisible . The laptop looks very outdatedThe keyboard buttons are not that easy and user friendly to input.Does n't look that nice as compared to other laptops of same price band Very good machine for home user . Got 9500 discount for my old i3 laptop . Thus verygood value for money Worst product screen flickering issue & restarting issue .. waste of money This product firstly do n't have a Ethernet port which is a big drawback for such a good spec laptop .. performance is good no doubt .. however considering internet as a priority .. HP has disappointed us with just a 50mbps throughput wireless adapter .. And i do n't have any clue whether external usb to ethernet would work and if works what would be it 's throughput . Pls do n't buy , it started getting hanged , and screen blaout in very first month now.Hp warranty nit responding Great laptop . Even great is that this model shows 2666mHz , but mine laptop displays 3200mhz . In task manager😍 😍 . Apps open fast and fluent . Boot up time after installing games and apps heavy ones like gta 5 , obs studio , Sony Vegas Pro 14 , Photoshop cc , Camtasia studio , fifa 19 and many more apps , still boot up in maximum 6-7 seconds . 🔥 😘 . Ssd is nvme m.2 512gb . Great IPS display quality too . Laptop was delivered on time and works very well . HP laptops have a good build quality and are sturdy . For anyone looking for a reliable laptop which can be used for routine computing , this laptop is definitely worth considering . Came with a long adaptor cable as well making it convenient to work with . Good pricing and excellent online support are additional benefits . A value for money productPros -1 . 11th gen iCore processor is very fast2 . okayish camera3 . Faster access to files ( SSD present ) 4 . Wide screen laptopCons -1 . Battery life is not what was expected.2 . Position of fan in the laptop is very weird ( not in the sides , rather below the display screen ) 3 . Extreme Heat up during high performance tasks which heats up the display screen ( check point 2 in cons ) HP India team is declining to register this product under warranty and says warranty is expired . There is no sticker of MS office Home and Student 2019 on laptop and MS office person is not installing MS office as on Invoice only MS office is written . Pathetic support from Amazon for not even able to revise invoice . Fast processing , very easy to set up and start using . Only thing i felt that can be improved is the display . Otherwise perfectly great choice . Boot speed is really good . Best product to buy in this range . I bought this laptop for my daughters who are attending online classes . The product proved to be very useful for their requirements . Fast delivery and special discount of Rs.1250 on SBI Card helped me buy this product in a great deal . Thank you Amazon for such an offer . fingerprint sensor not on system but on a paper within the box .. backlight sensor only in picture actually missing from keypad F5 .. Battery 3 hours max that too for a basic school purpose .. this laptop is value for money booting fast , sound quality is good if you want to buy a laptop of 45k go for this laptop . Laptop is good for school going Students and to do general home stuff.SSD enhance the performance experience.Should have provided bag or sleeve to keep the laptop . Almost using this for 3 months now , use it 5 days for 5hrs of personal work per week . Still now no problem or hazards . The built quality could have been more better but as per the configuration no complain . Excellent and I love this product from HP . Fully satisfied . The system works well , but afraid when it would break . Change from plastic to better material will make it complete It is hanging for opening a single application . Please do n't buy this laptop . I bought this laptop last week and it starts giving issues like hanging , taking time while typing . Worth to buy . The free Macafee trial pack of one month not provided . When wrote to HP they said talk to supplier . Computer is showing your trial offer expired .. Key board is not user friendly . Visibility of letters , words , fullstop , coma is poor . Keypads quality is very poor Pro 's -Speed is very fastClean look and big screenLightweightCons -Material used looks cheap and low quality Really a wonderful product i love the way it was protected and delivered to me loved itThabks amazon for such a wonderful productThe boot up is really cool it takes just less than 5 sec to boot up cool Good batteryBad keyboardSound system is worstWe have to purchase Ms office toolsLaptop is not strong at handling or carryingNo camera facing or covering and open camera The laptop got crashed after 18 days . Not able to start it , on starting it says boot device not found . Raised issue with HP customer care , they were not able to solve it and told somebody will contact for part replacement but no body called till now . Did not expect that Amazon will send faulty laptop . Pathetic service from Amazon and HP . The warranty is found to have started around 4 months before I purchased the laptop , I couldn ’ t understand the issue . Is it a used one ? Doesn ’ t look like , but concerns about the warranty remains . Display is good.Fully charged in 30-40 mins ( 3-4hr battery backup ) .Lifetime free microsoft office is there.Backlit keyboard not there but its fine for me.Little bit slow compared to other hp-15 laptops due to 2666mhz ramspeed.Except everything works fine . From day one I am facing hanging problem done many complaints to HP but still no resolution battery backup is too low battery is not even working after 6 months but still I do n't get any response .... from `` HP '' .. nice laptop . fast . doesnt have the beat webcam but good enough for all we do . the laptop is fast , and comes with functional softwares as detailed . packaging excellent . Laptop is nice u can use it for online classes and offices workBought this for online classes , running very smoothlyOnly Battery is the lessEverything is perfect Bad experience plz do n't buy online get the product was not goodMs office was not permanent I called hp they fixed itAfter that I see my warranty was started 3 month before my purchaseStill I I 'm contacting with Amazon and hp to make my warranty from my purchase date Good product for online classes or light usage . Using for almost 3 months now , a single problem has n't occurred yet . Would try to update if anything goes wrong , but very honestly , I am having a good experience , this being my first laptop Excellent product . Key board spacing very nice . Battery life is good & pin location is ok. Nice HD diaplay . Light wt . helps in easy movement . Also those who buy this laptop , must buy laptop bag also , as it is very very handy . Price is worth . Top finish silver colour is of class . Worst laptop .. bought it two months back and it has started troubling a lot .. its so slow and hangs a lot😡 Product is good and met my expectations . It is very good value for money . Would have however appreciated the inclusion of a mouse and a computer bag along with the product . Good quality laptop . , Storage model , SSD solid state drive , . Very fast and good working. , processor Intel core i3 , .11gen , . Ms office , . System fast charging , . Better battery backup , .Is an very useful and worth of amount in system✌️👍 High heat up during charging & during use both.Rest running no issuesOnly heat up problem I have been using a for a month no issues . Product id as expected . Recieved damaged product , very disappointed with HP built quality and service , requested for replacement Battery should have more power . Keypad letters to be more visible on keys , it is lightly written . The laptop is one of the best in the price range . Ticks all the boxes for me in terms of configuration - SSD hard disk 512 GB , 8GB RAM . 2 weeks in , the laptop is doing just fine . Definitely will recommend this one . I am completely stunned how fast 512 gb ssd rendered my pc . This pc is fasinating not only by looks and display but also elegant when comes to smooth performence . Completely satisfied by product .

       "'In specification  mentioned 4 1 Ghz processes but I received 30 GHz processor  It is a cheating  Seller take money for high configuration and provide low configuration 😥 While setting up the laptop  screen went wonky  total colour distortion and hung up  Have asked replacement  do nt know if it s worth buying Speaker is buzzing  new laptop  out of the boxEdit  The replacement laptop speaker is the same  You wo nt hear the buzzing while listening to a song or video however while increasing or decreasing system volume  the chimes crack  also for Windows pop ups  the chime sound cracks at more than 50  volume  Really weird issue  It s a awsm laptop with premium looks and great performance  It was good just for 7 days post delivery  I am not sure if i made a mistake buying it online  Laptop stopped working on 8th day and i had no option to place a request for replacement  I called customer service of HP they said within 48 hrs technician should visit and it s been more than 48 hrs and i have not even received any call  I spent Rs 42k and as i have to do work from home  my work is hampering also  Cpu turns on but no display  Did all troubleshooting but no improvement for this NEW GEN HP LAPTOPOn 27th HP sent an engineer and they are ready to help howver my case is pending as of 16th April  as Amazon did not mention the serial num on invoice and pslip  HP needs invoice with Serial number  I am very much disappointed as i am stuck between two big brands  it is good if machine works fine if you are unlucky then may gon na pissed off after sale  Let s see how long do i have to wait to obtain the correct invoice from HPNote accept invoice with sr number mentioned on it then only HP can entertain easily  Hi  I am totally disappointed with this purchase  I have spend the heavy amount but still i could nt use the product  My request for replacement also not happened due to some irrelevant reason  I bought this laptop for son s study purpose  Due to this bad sales service my son s study also got impacted  Now this defective item is with me last 10 days  If my problem is not resolved in another two days  I will take this issue in next very seriouslyRequest your immediation action to resolve the issueThanks and Regards  Kajamydeen T Horrible experience  First there was flinch in the screen ao i had to talk to the customer service for 2 hours before they declared it fit to be replaced  After I got a replaced laptop within 5 days the speakers went off  they started producing the most obnoxious voices  But till i realised i had to return it again it the 8th day and amazon could nt replace  So I contacted hp they helped me but everyday i had to sit for hours talking to them explaining them their person came home checked it labelled it suitable to be replaced boxed it seqled it saying amazon will pick up  But nothing  Nor from Amazons side nor from hp its been 1 month now my laptop is sealed and kept  I m calling everyday mailing everyday but no response  Its like my 50000₹ have gone down the drain  Horrible services from both sides  I bought HP15s fr 2006tu it was delivered on 27032021When I was doing simple work but its laptop charger and laptop also getting heating problem so kindly see that and resolve the issue Print on the keyboard keys is thin  font size and color   Keyboard body color is silver  This makes it problematic to read keyboard keys  Especially at night when it shines due to room lights  This is bad design  It should be either in contrast color  black keyboard with white font  or it should come with backlit keyboard  I even did not like display quality  If looking for performance this laptop has best config and price comb  Boot in 56 sec  No lag  You get windows and office  Packing was good  All seal were intactIt can easily compete with i 5 9genBut butbut there are some issuesFirst  The plastic quality is not that good  When you type the whole keypad goes down as the plastic there is thinBattery backup is only 335hours with averahe loadThe mcafee subscription was over when i got the laptop which is weird  But windows defender overcomes the need of any third party anti virusOverall for performance its the best bang for your buck  Go for it  Just buy a wireless mouse for better effciencyScreen is also good but could have been brighter It seems this laptop has an inbuilt problem  As somebody mentioned in the review  the laptop frequently hangs  lots of pixels appear on screen  and restarts after that  I do nt recommend this laptop to anybody  Bought it for 41999  so far have nt faced any issueNot so good things to consider before you purchase it1 build quality  very fragile  wo nt survive a drop2  speaker  average3  camera  below average4  Missing RJ45 portI will update my review if I face any issueI am writing this review after using this laptop for more than a week  I will keep it short and to the point  Good things1  I just loved its design and it is beautiful  Soothing silver color and very sleek  it just feels nice to touch the smooth surface2  It is significantly lighter weight3  Sound is good in this price range  I am satisfied4  Speed is awesome  Core I3  11th gen  and the SSD both make it awesome to work5  Display  it is a bit warm display but very clear  Soothing to eyes  Night mode is also good6  Bluetooth connectivity is also great  My earlier HP laptop used to drop the connection in between but this works seamlessly7  it is very thin  I liked itThings need improvement I did not like much1  It gets heat up in just 30 mins of usage2  It has only 2 USB ports that too together with charging port  This makes difficult to connect 2 USB and charger at the same time due to size of pen drive or devices port like mouse or external HDD3  The cooling fan is at the bottom not at the sides which may be causing heat up issues because when you use it on the bed as many times we do  it does not work efficiently4  Memory of SSD is only 512 GB which gets reduced by almost 100 GB due to OS and all  Of course  this is what is mentioned in the technical specification but this is something which bothers me slightly  They could have given 1 HDD of 1 TB and SSD combination which Dell and other laptops are providing  But this is not that bad  It is fine if you do nt store much on the drive and use the cloud5  Charger pin which we connect with a laptop is not very smooth  It has a lot to improve  I can not connect smoothly as my earlier Lenovo  Dell  and HP laptops6  It does not have a CD drive which is something missing  People who have old CDsDVDs of marriages and functions might miss this  I do   Conclusion  By and large  this is a perfect laptop for normal usages like studies and work  Not suitable for gaming though  Its lightweight  slim design and soothing silver color appearance backed with 11th gen core i3 processor with SSD makes it perfect and fast to use  I recommend this to users who wan na use it for work and study purposes  I wish the USB port should have been more scattered instead of consolidated near the charging port  Overall  awesome product  I am happy with this  I made this review after using this laptop for 3 months as a good laptop to buy under 42KI used it for last two months and I only faced the problem regarding battery life  Battery consumed very quickly and also there was a issue of heating  Although heating problem was normal in laptops  Otherwise it was vey fast  response quickly and no lag  The camera was not so good  It was weighing light and thin and also it has a gloomy metal like finish which makes it s look quite awesome  Overall it was good for normal uses  I got this product without any fault and as it was depicted in the display  I am working with i5  i7 laptops and this is my first laptop i3 have nt notice big difference because of SSD and 11th generation version without hard drive  Setup took very less time  very fast processing  Sound quality good and Picture quality satisfactory  Within this cost I must say it s fabulous  must buy and enjoy working  I will not suggest for gaming purpose  Silver colour body makes executive looks  slim and very handy  Light weight and elegant design  I must give five star but somewhere I do nt know I am rating four star  may be something missing like sound card  Overall it s good laptop  Let s see in coming days how it performs and battery life  good luck  Product is very poor  Product finishing is very bad  I have a doubt that whether it is original or not  This computer hanged on first day  I had to force restart it  Battery life is good but for having a SSD it took 1 hour for restart after even first update  I am using from last few days  Every thing is doing well  amazing speed  no lags  speakers  mic is well  Installation is fast and easy  Even heavy softwares run smoothly  Till now I am fully satisfied  If I found something wrong in coming days I will inform  This laptop closed many times  Screen always gets crashed if we are watching any video Or doing any work  And exchange date has also crossed  I m not satisfied with the laptop  Only 10 Or 12 days has crossed  And arising lots of problem The build quality is not so great for the price  Even the keys look as if it s painted in bulk  Could have been black and that d make the device look betterAbout HW  whne the tech improved over years  as I had paid 50k for similar config 10yrs back  with i5 core  1TB storage  DVD RW  8gb RAM  Radeon Graphics etc  there is no improvement in price nowNot a config comparable for yhe price expectation over 10yrsNo DVD  no 1TB storage  Not much RAM and still price is sameConsidering the Moors law by wich the semicon industry swears by  the actual price of this laptop must be 25k  As I buy this since day when I start using within 2 days 1fan got faulty2 Hanging issue 3poor service  I have raised issue with HP but they only checking hard disc and saying everything is normal  I have already reinstalled the os but issue is not resolved  Dint buy HP and product from Amazon  I have been using it from last 2 weeks  and i found this hp 15 fr 2006 laptop the best thin and light laptop in this price segment  Laptop has good processing speed because of ssd and it generally takes 24 secs to switch on and shut down and overall speed while operating i have witnessed its extremely high processing speed better as compare to hdd laptop especially the  HANG  problem which is not there in this laptop and gives an extra advantage doing work smoothly  So it works perfectly fine for performing day to day official work  I have followed some of the reviews before buying this laptop and read multiple reviews regarding its heating issue which caught my attention certainly and tried to change my mind  but however i knew that if you buy any machinery it will come with n number of features and advantage and it do have little drawback which every machinery have and its we human who have to deal with it the way we use it in our daily life with self care and effort so i ordered this laptop thinking in positive way and i found that there is minor or simply no heating issue the way other people exaggerated as i have been using it from last 2 weeks and for continously 5 to 6 hours in a laptop with single charge  So overall its a good deal buying this laptop  Just go for it  I purchased this device with the exchange offer  so it was even cheaper for me  Pros1  SSD provides great booting time of 45 seconds2  Smartly placed vent does nt make it uncomfortable if it heats up a bit  also  pretty quiet3  i3 11th gen tiger lake cpus are 😎  Minecraft runs with full graphics settings at 60fps consistently  capable device for coding  not for graphic intensive purposes  4  Sound is pretty good in this speakers  loud  and crisp  but base could have been better  supports spatial audio  headphone output  5  Trackpad is smooth  responsive  supports all gestures6  Active Noise cancelling microphones7  5 hours of battery life  at least  for browsing and video streamingCons1Camera quality  pretty noisy2  Lots of bloatware from HP3an ethernet port and micro SD card slot would be appreciated4  Type c port only upto 4GBPS transfer speed5  Keyboard might feel soft for some  personal preference  Scratchy sound from speaker even after reinstalling windows  Requesting for replacementThe replaced product worked well for 3 days but now the scratchy sound is back  Requested for Amazon technician to visitPost technician visit I had to return the Laptop and Amazon has refunded the entire amountBased on my experience and online research I would like to state that 11th generation Laptop from HP has audio issues  I have now ordered 10th generation Laptop  Just got it so first observations some might help There are only 2 USB ports  1 Type C USB  1 HDMI Port  1 card reader  1 microphone slotThere is no LAN port  WIFI is there but LAN is faster and added valueSilver color with light grey typed alphabets and no backlit  I think HP was playing a joke on customer to figure out keys or learn typingBattery life seems ok  TOUCHED MY LAPTOP AFTER 4Hrs USAGE  CAN COOK AN OMLETTE AT BACKSSD drive is fast so go for it  minimum 512GB makes senseBody quality looks cheap plasticAmazon Prime day sales is a scam  same price and offer available other daysDelivery is super and fastlaptop is lighter than previous versionNo MS OFFICE  ONLY TRIAL VERSION WHICH IS SO IRRITATING  YOU CHARGE SO MUCH AND CANT OFFER OFFICEOverall at this price is a good dealHope it works as good over a longer period of time First my husband ordered a HP laptop from his account which we had to return as a used piece was sent to us which had many technical issues  after a long struggle and completing various protocol we returned the laptop and for the money back  NOW SECOND TIME I ORDERED WINDOWS 10 FROM MY ACCOUNT BUT I RECEIVED WINDOWS 8 WHEREAS I PAID FOR WINDOWS 10  STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO EXCHANGE IT  BAD DECISION TO INVEST IN HP GUYS  This laptop I had purchased on 13 August and got on 18  I am writing this review after 10 days of usage  Till now  it is working bestPROS  Best speed of laptopBudget LaptopBest displayLightWeightBoot time is 8 secondsIncredible speedCONS  No ConsGO FOR ITI will edit the review if there is some problem  On 2nd day of use after unpacking the box  all of a sudden the CPU fan started making cranking sound and screen got frozen  This happened again on the 4th day  I am returning it now  Very disappointed  received a faulty laptop  keyboard issue   and when i reached out to HP CC  experienced the worst ever  They say its not covered in warranty  I confronted saying that i should have received a good laptop  iits not matter of warranty and the parrot who called me kept repeating the same lines his boss gave him  and they closed my case  I have no idea what kind of services they intend to provide  This being the fifth laptop in my life this is the first time the i faced issues with keyboard within four monthsI received the laptop the keys where stiff  i thought it might get bit loosen with use  it got worst  I just paid my last emi  and the function keys stick in if i press those  would not pop out  the W key is plucked out  Customer care people are arrogant as always  pretending like they doing us favour  No point of getting into technical details as the basic body design is problematicThe edge is ao sharp that if you are using it for long time the sharp edge puts pressure on your hand around the wrist area depending on size of your handFor someone wanting to use laptop for long hours its a curseBut the machine has no return policyEven the keyboard contrast is not really eye friendlyReal disappointment on basic design front  Product delivery took time  but was delivered without any issuesLaptop looks good with silver colorSpeaker quality is goodScreen quality is goodBoot time is quickLeight weight and build quality is good  plastic  for this price rangePerformance seems good  need to wait and watchBattery life need to checkWebcam average  still managable  The processor is 3Ghz not 4 as mentioned in description  Also  there is no MS office preinstalled  I called HP support and they say I have to purchase MS office  Also the mcafee antivirus trial version say expired 2 months Ago  not sure if this is an used product  it s kind of cheating  Also amazon has rejected my exchange offer at the time of delivery and I had to pay the amount that was offered as exchange because the old laptop s display has few black spots  But at the time of availing the exchange there is no option to mention such issuesOther things I am yet to verify as today only received the product  Hi  here is my experience after use of 8 months  It s a good laptop which can do everything as per my requirements  I m not a gamer or coder  Surfing  dowloading  online classes  meetings etc can be done without any hassleBattery is 4 hours only  You can watch 2 movies back to backConnectivity is goodAlmost all apps are workingIt s very fast due to ssd  On and Off in just 4 secondsSound output is goodMicrophone is also goodWin 11 free updateIt s heavyIt s heating much during video call and online classes  The free antivirus that comes with the product was already expired  Also the warranty for 1 year was reduced  Laptop stopped working within a week of purchase  Seems that a used piece was delivered The seller Appario private limited delivered me pre used one  When i try to activate the MS office 2019 product key which is not activated because it is already used and the product warranty shows only 10 month remaining  It is not a good practice the seller delivered a used lap  Returned the lap and amazon issued refund without delay  Before purchase I compared similar configuration of Dell Vostro which was 5K less than this HP and Dell Inspiron which was 25K more than this HP  Finally I feel better to have this as the Laptop body is stylish and IPS display is awesomeOnly minor problem I had was with McAfee which did nt open when I tried to open during first boot of my Windows 10 however after I restarted it opened but funny to see on my first day with the brand new laptop as it said  Your trial ended 14days ago   Since product description does nt say Antivirus subscription I m ok with thisThis is my Day1 experience I will have to see its performance in long run  if any problem I will definitely update my review here  It s a light weight laptop and quickly boots and shut downBiggest flaw in this laptop is  it keeps hanging every now and then  You must restart and reconnect to your meeting or classes  Please do nt buy this  I had very good laptops from HP earlier but this is not worth itAvoid buying Battery last for whole day work from home  Very light weight as compared to my previous Dell Laptop  There is no fingerprint reader or CDDVD writer  Image from all dimension has been uploaded by me for information of any future buyer  It have great speed as it s 11th Gen i3 processor  8 GB RAM with SSD for quick start  Window operating system clash with one week  hp service center denied to attend  as per discussion with them there is no any issue at hardware side so they do nothinggave customer care number of software site of hp for on line support  When I bought this laptop it was mentioned windows 10 over there  but during setup it automatically updated to windows 11 that windows 11 laptop was little bit of lower price in online  but its ok  i liked the quality and performance  below this i have written advantages and disadvantagesAdvantages It is the one of the best laptops  battery backup is good and light weight also  and main thing its performance is outstanding  because of SSD very smooth running laptop  Microsoft office 2019 version for lifetime which i liked the most  you can buy it also  it is good for student and you can also use autoCAD software  overall built quality is good and looking also good Disadvantages it is not for high gamming performance laptop and price is little bit of high  It s been only two days my laptop is not charging wow my brother have same laptop but luckily not purchase from Amazon because Amazon always have habit to delivered defective or replaced one  I will suggest not to purchase laptop from Amazon better purchase offline when I asked for return there a huge long process how I mean and here we are suffering like hell  I bought an HP laptop on 23rd March  through Amazon  In a week itself  it got stuck or restarted on its own several times  Till now it got stuckrestarted more than 50 times  I contacted HPSA and HP Whatsapp support and tried everything to rectify it  2 days back I did cloud recovery with the help of HP Whatsapp support  After that also  my laptop got stuckrestarted 3 times  I am very unhappy and I regret buying an HP laptop  I purchased this product  First thing i see is built in quality is very poor  made of poor plastic  Battery is daring like hell  Back up is not more than 4hrsI wanted to return this laptop on 2nd day of my delivery and buy some other Laptop from Amazon  but As per customer service it is not possible to return this laptop  i can only get replacement with same laptop which i do nt want  This puts my concerns to buy any electronic product from Amazon which you have not seen physically  Better to buy this type of products from Local electronic shops though they are bit expensiveI recommend not to buy this laptop online  You will not be able to return or get replacement with other laptop models if you want to  Worst experience ever  Available Warranty is only 9month  also McAfee subscription is already expired either this is a used product or refurbished  set up was simple and easyPerformance so far is OKBack lit key pad is a must  missing it here Got a good exchange deal and a very good and smooth laptopBooting is really quickHave nt noticed any lags after one month of useIt is light weight and easy to carryThough sometimes it feels that the screen movement will get loose soonMy only complain is with Amazon  for using huge boxes and lots of dunnage to pack the laptop box  It is unnecessary wastage  Please do nt buy this laptopi purchased this laptop  within 10 days I found many issues with this laptopsome times system gets hangedim facing lot off problem with keyboard  caps lock automatically on Nd it will not respond even if we try to offFinally my opinion is not to buy  Delivered a day earlier  The laptop is exactly what I expected  The SSD makes a big difference in the speed of boot and usage8GB RAM with the laptop is required as even without any applications  Windows10  antivirus and other startup programs takes up more than 40  RAM  Alexa is a good add on  All in all a good buy  Received a faulty laptop  amazon sent an executive next day and confrmed the same  Thanks to Amazon for approving the refund  however pick up guy delayed the process of refund  Recently for my earlier pc  from hp itself  I came to know that the extended warranty  I had taken was of no use  when it came to changing the expensive battery  this is the part which most often goes bad  so when it comes to getting the battery replaced  extended warranty of no use  This was such a pathetic experience  I am very impressed with HP laptop because booting is so fast in the system  If I talk about battery backup 45 hours is enough  This is not fast charging I can say because it takes more time to charge more than 2 hours 0100Sound quality is Awesome  Video quality superior 4K video plays smoothly  No heating or no noise from the system  Overall it deserves 5 star  I bought this a couple months ago  It s sleek  elegant  and light  It s working well without any problems  The only problem I have faced is  when my mobile vibrates  the laptop  when beside the mobile  rattles sometimes  I guess it s got to do with the outer casing of the laptop  It s not a major inconvenience though  The product quality is really bad  Laptop s plastic quality is so bad that while holding the laptop  you will feel the laptop can break any time  Not expected this kind of quality from HPThe keyboard is another big issue here  the characters on the keyboard are very light and are not visible even from 1 meter away  You need to bend down and type the lettersLastly the amazon service support is also poor  as per the policy they would not replace the product if there are quality issues that I discussed above  They will only replace in case of defect  Cheap product  Already has someone else s log in and felt like refurbished product very disappointed in amazon and seller instead of providing replacement giving refund Worst product  after operating the laptop for 5 minutes the screen got invisible  The laptop looks very outdatedThe keyboard buttons are not that easy and user friendly to inputDoes nt look that nice as compared to other laptops of same price band Very good machine for home user  Got 9500 discount for my old i3 laptop  Thus verygood value for money Worst product screen flickering issue  restarting issue  waste of money This product firstly do nt have a Ethernet port which is a big drawback for such a good spec laptop  performance is good no doubt  however considering internet as a priority  HP has disappointed us with just a 50mbps throughput wireless adapter  And i do nt have any clue whether external usb to ethernet would work and if works what would be it s throughput  Pls do nt buy  it started getting hanged  and screen blaout in very first month nowHp warranty nit responding Great laptop  Even great is that this model shows

cores temperature rises upto 67 °C during normal use  Hangs and gets off all of a sudden since day one  Complete waste if money  within 13 days of purchase I faced motherboard and display issue as
